# In Development

## AWEngine
Not a game but custom 3D Vulkan-based game engine with low-level access from C++.

## Voxelite
Creative game with 3D textured voxels and server-side customization.

Every server is different experience thanks to server-side plugins adding new blocks and entities.

## Decay
Fan-made re-creation of [GoldSrc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoldSrc) engine for learning and preservation purpose.

Basic functionality implemented in C++20 and mode-specific functionality scripted using [Lua](https://www.lua.org/).
Primary goal is to preserve Half-Life and its modes for next generation by using Vulkan and GLFW.

The implementation is fully custom = no original code used.

# Drafts

## Soul-Eater
Souls-like core game with [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) scripting and custom loaders for Souls-borne game series.
